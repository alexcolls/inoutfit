  [Instruction/Description]: Use the provided reference image(s) as identity + outfit reference. Create a photorealistic commercial fashion photo of [AVATAR_DESCRIPTION] wearing the exact same outfit shown in the reference image.

  [Identity Lock - CRITICAL]: Preserve the exact same person/identity as the reference. Do NOT change face shape, eyes, nose, lips, jawline, hairstyle, hair color, skin tone, body type, proportions, age, or ethnicity. No face swap, no beautification, no body reshaping.
  If multiple reference images are provided: use the FIRST image primarily for identity (face/body), and the SECOND image primarily for outfit/styling.

  [Pose]: Natural and flirty (tasteful). 3/4 angle, one arm bent with hand on hip OR gently holding the opposite elbow. Slight torso twist to show silhouette. Relaxed confident expression.

  [Shot]: Full-body, 3/4 angle (turned slightly left), centered, feet visible.

  [Environment]: Minimal studio set (neutral background with subtle gradient), no clutter.

  [Lighting]: Soft key light + gentle fill, subtle rim light to separate from background, crisp details.

  [Quality]: High-end lookbook, sharp focus, realistic textures, accurate colors.

  [Constraints]: Keep the outfit identical. Do not change patterns, colors, or silhouettes. Do not add items (no hats, bags, jewelry). No text, no watermarks, no logos.
  [Safety]: No nudity. Keep it tasteful and suitable for an online clothing store.
