  [Instruction/Description]: Use the provided reference image(s) as identity + outfit reference. Create a photorealistic commercial fashion photo of [AVATAR_DESCRIPTION] wearing the exact same outfit shown in the reference image.

  [Identity Lock - CRITICAL]: Preserve the exact same person/identity as the reference. Do NOT change face shape, eyes, nose, lips, jawline, hairstyle, hair color, skin tone, body type, proportions, age, or ethnicity. No face swap, no beautification, no body reshaping.
  If multiple reference images are provided: use the FIRST image primarily for identity (face/body), and the SECOND image primarily for outfit/styling.

  [Pose]: Editorial, natural, subtly sensual (tasteful). A gentle walking step OR a soft turn with head looking over the shoulder. Arms positioned differently (one arm raised slightly, or hand brushing hair). Confident posture.

  [Shot]: Full-body, dynamic angle, feet visible.

  [Environment]: Clean studio backdrop (neutral warm gray) with a gentle vignette, no props.

  [Lighting]: Editorial studio lighting with soft contrast, gentle rim light, realistic shadows, sharp focus.

  [Quality]: Premium clothing store gallery image, high detail, accurate colors, realistic fabric drape.

  [Constraints]: Outfit must remain identical to the reference. Do not add accessories. No text, no watermarks, no logos, no background objects.
  [Safety]: No nudity. Keep it tasteful and suitable for an online clothing store.
